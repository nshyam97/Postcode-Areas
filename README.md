# Postcode-Areas

The csv file was used for one of my University projects where I wanted to match a house postcode to an area within the UK so I could then geocode the location. 
This data was made available from https://www.gbmaps.com/downloadpostcodemap.htm

The python file is a code snippet which allowed me to obtain the postcode area from a UK postcode using regex
